# Code Review: Compze.Build.FlexRef

## Overall Assessment

This is a well-designed, well-documented project that solves a real problem clearly. The architecture is clean, the MSBuild integration is clever, and the documentation (README, design doc, examples) is excellent. The codebase is small, focused, and avoids over-engineering. Below are findings organized by severity.


## Design Concerns

## Bugs / Correctness Issues

### 6. `Version="*-*"` in generated PackageReference

`ManagedProject.CsprojUpdater.cs` line 78: Generated flex references use `Version="*-*"` (floating, including prereleases). This means:

- Builds are non-deterministic — two developers can get different package versions.
- CI builds that use PackageReference mode will resolve whatever latest version exists.
- No lock file is generated by default.

This is clearly a conscious design choice (you don't want to manage version pinning in the tool), but it's worth at least a prominent callout in the README. For production use, consumers would need to use `Directory.Packages.props` (Central Package Management) or a lock file to get reproducible builds.

### 7. Original package version is discarded during csproj update

`ManagedProject.CsprojUpdater.cs` lines 23–29: `RemoveExistingFlexReferences` strips all matching `PackageReference` and `ProjectReference` elements, then `AppendFlexReferencePairs` writes them back with `Version="*-*"`. If a user had `Version="2.1.0"` pinned, it's silently overwritten. This compounds issue #6 — running `flexref sync` is destructive to version information. Consider preserving the original version if one was present.

### 10. No `--dry-run` or diff mode

The tool modifies files in place with no preview option. For a tool that rewrites `.csproj` and `Directory.Build.props` files, a `--dry-run` flag showing what would change would build user confidence. Not a bug, but a significant UX gap.~
